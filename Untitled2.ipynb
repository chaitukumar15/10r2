            "1.  **Save:** Copy the code and save it in a file named `guess_game.py` (or any other name ending with `.py`).\n",
            "2.  **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n",
            "3.  **Run:** Type `python guess_game.py` and press Enter.\n",
            "\n",
            "### What the Code Does (Explained):\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **`import random`**: This line brings in Python's `random` module, which is needed to generate a random number.\n",
            "*   **`def guess_the_number():`**: Defines a function named `guess_the_number`. Functions help organize code and make it reusable.\n",
            "*   **`random.randint(1, 100)`**: This generates a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n",
            "*   **`max_guesses` and `guesses_taken`**: These variables keep track of how many attempts the user has and how many they've used.\n",
            "*   **`while guesses_taken < max_guesses:`**: This is a `while` loop that continues as long as the user hasn't run out of guesses.\n",
            "*   **`input(...)`**: Prompts the user to enter their guess and captures their input as a string.\n",
            "*   **`int(...)`**: Converts the user's input string into an integer.\n",
            "*   **`try...except ValueError`**: This is error handling. If the user types something that can't be converted to an integer (like \"hello\"), a `ValueError` occurs. The `except` block catches this error, prints a friendly message, and prevents the program from crashing.\n",
            "*   **`if/elif/else`**: These statements check the user's guess against the `secret_number` and provide feedback (\"Too low!\", \"Too high!\", or \"Congratulations!\").\n",
            "*   **`return`**: When the user guesses correctly, `return` exits the `guess_the_number` function, ending the game round.\n",
            "*   **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`**: This is a standard Python idiom. It ensures that `guess_the_number()` is called only when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module into another script).\n",
            "*   **Play Again Loop**: The `while True` loop after the main game allows the user to easily play multiple rounds without restarting the script.\n",
